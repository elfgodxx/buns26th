        <h2>A little something for you...</h2>
        <p><strong><em>“Maybe it’s the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all.”</em></strong></p>
        <p>That line always hits me because with you, I did, I am, and I always will. Falling for you meant losing the person I was and becoming someone so much better, someone who gets to be yours.</p>
        <p>Happy birthday, Buns. You’re my favorite person, and having you in it has made my world infinitely brighter and more meaningful.</p>
        <p>I never saw us coming, but now I can't imagine a world where we didn't happen. Thank you for giving me the incredible honor of being your girlfriend. I know I can get lost in my own head, lamenting over mistakes and annoy you when I sulk, but you're always there. Thank you for the nudges and for giving me chances even when my flaws feel so obvious.</p>
        <p>I love you, Buns. I am completely and truly diving into you, into us. I wish you all the happiness in the world today and every day after.</p>
        <p>Even though I can't steal you for the whole day, I will cherish the first few hours of your birthday with you before the world needs us back. mwa</p>

        Love,
        <br>
        Jia
