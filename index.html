           Happy birthday, Buns. Other than myself, you have become the most important person in my life. You are my favorite person.
        </p>
        <p>  
            I never expected us to happen, but hey we happened, and I thank you for giving me the honor to be your girlfriend. I may get distracted and lament over my mistakes and sulk, but thank you for the slight nudges, for the chances even my mistakes are so obvious and evident.
        </p>
        <p>I love you, Buns. And I am indeed diving into you. I wish you well, and I hope you enjoy this day.</p>
        <p>I may not be able to steal you for the rest of the day, but at least, I could spend the first few hours before our work with you.        </p>
